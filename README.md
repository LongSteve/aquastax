# aquastax
This is the repo for my remake of AquaStax, a 2007 mobile puzzle game.

![Splash Screen](/reference/aquastax_anim_01_240x320_efigs.gif?raw=true "")

The game will use the Cocos2d-JS framework, and be coded in Javascript, with possibly some old Java tools.

I will be live streaming the work I do on this project on Thursdays at 3pm UK time:
