ONGOING
Fix the blocks sliding sideways into place.
Partially done, but need to understand how to aligne the blocks vertically properly.  Currently
there's a 2.5 magic number in the y offset.

** Figure out how the keyboard repeat works, and decide if it's possible to use actually keyPressed/keyReleased
functionality. **

TO REFACTOR
1) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
