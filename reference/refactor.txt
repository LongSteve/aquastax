ONGOING

Stack clustering/grouping.

Implement the block breaking.  See the grid.breakBlock method and use the block.collision_points
data.

BUGS

One bug at the moment :-(
When sliding using the fast drop, blocks can stutter.  Possibly due to moving over grid cell boundaries.

TO REFACTOR
99) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
