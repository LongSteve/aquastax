ONGOING
Fix the blocks sliding sideways into place.  Have now worked out a solution for this, using left and right
key pressed and stored previous frame values for could_move_left and could_move_right. *Hopefully Fixed*

TO REFACTOR
1) All the boilerplate code for indicators (using DrawNode) in game.js.  Lots of copy and paste there.
2) Move the block movement functions out of game.update into it's own 'handleBlockMove' method (or something)
3) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
