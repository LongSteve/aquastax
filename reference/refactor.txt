ONGOING
Fix the blocks sliding sideways into place.  I did this, but broke it again with the key repeat handling

Partially done, but need to understand how to aligne the blocks vertically properly.  Currently
there's a 2.5 magic number in the y offset.

Abstract the keyboard keys so that in the future I can redefine them without change all the code

TO REFACTOR
1) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
