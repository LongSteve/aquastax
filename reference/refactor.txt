ONGOING

Fix bugs 1 and 2.

Move onto stack clustering/grouping.

BUGS
1) Rotating a block into a place where a triangle will overlap with an equal triangle in the grid, causes the
   block to overlap.  It might be because the collision test when rotating (game.js:196) doesn't take into
   account of the y axis movement (down) that should occur in the frame.
2) Rotating a block when it's moving down next to a solid vertical stack, the rotation stops and cannot be
   continued until the block is moved left or right.  Happens on the 2x1 blocks.

TO REFACTOR
99) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
