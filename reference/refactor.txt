ONGOING

Stack clustering/grouping.  Build upon the flood fill routine to iterate over blocks of the game colour, taking
into account the triangle points.

Grouping the blocks together results in more groups than it should.  Fix this.

BUGS

One bug at the moment :-(
When sliding using the fast drop, blocks can stutter.  Possibly due to moving over grid cell boundaries.

TO REFACTOR
99) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
