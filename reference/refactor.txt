ONGOING

Stack clustering/grouping

Implement the addBlockOutline function properly.

BUGS

One bug at the moment :-(
When sliding using the fast drop, blocks can stutter.  Possibly due to moving over grid cell boundaries.

TO REFACTOR
99) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
