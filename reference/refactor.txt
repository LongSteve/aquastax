ONGOING

Stack clustering/grouping.

Re-organize the 'make block' code so it actually makes a real Block object from the combined
grid data.

Refactor the flood fill to remove copy/pasted code blocks and possibly simplify.

BUGS

One bug at the moment :-(
When sliding using the fast drop, blocks can stutter.  Possibly due to moving over grid cell boundaries.

TO REFACTOR
99) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
