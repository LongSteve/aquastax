ONGOING

Stack clustering/grouping.  Build upon the flood fill routine to iterate over blocks of the same colour, taking
into account the triangle points.

Refactor the flood fill to remove copy/pasted code blocks and possibly simplify.

BUGS

One bug at the moment :-(
When sliding using the fast drop, blocks can stutter.  Possibly due to moving over grid cell boundaries.

TO REFACTOR
99) Rename block or grid functions that only operate on single cells (that is, the 50x50 grid cell sized elements)
